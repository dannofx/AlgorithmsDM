// 13.6.1 Dog and Gopher

//A large field has a dog and a gopher. The dog wants to eat the gopher, while the
//gopher wants to run to safety through one of several gopher holes dug in the surface
//of the field.
//Neither the dog nor the gopher is a math major; however, neither is entirely stupid.
//The gopher decides on a particular gopher hole and heads for that hole in a straight
//line at a fixed speed. The dog, which is very good at reading body language,
//anticipates which hole the gopher has chosen. The dog heads at double the speed of the
//gopher to the hole. If the dog reaches the hole first, the gopher gets gobbled up;
//otherwise, the gopher escapes.
//You have been retained by the gopher to select a hole through which it can escape, if
//such a hole exists.
