// 13.6.2 Rope Crisis in Ropeland!


//Rope-pulling (also known as tug of war) is a very popular game in Ropeland, just
//like cricket is in Bangladesh. Two groups of players hold different ends of a rope
//and pull. The group that snatches the rope from the other group is declared
//winner.
//Due to a rope shortage, the king of the country has declared that groups will not
//be allowed to buy longer ropes than they require.
//Rope-pulling takes place in a large room, which contains a large round pillar of a
//certain radius. If two groups are on the opposite side of the pillar, their pulled
//rope cannot be a straight line. Given the position of the two groups, find out the
//minimum length of rope required to start rope-pulling. You can assume that a point
//represents the position of each group.
