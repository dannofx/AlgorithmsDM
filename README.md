# Algorithm problems

This repository contains some exercises, examples and data structures from the book The Algorithm Design Manual, everything was made using Swift 4.

# Others

Additionally, it contains some other popular problems, algorithms, and structures that came up frequently when I was reading this book. These additional items are listed here:
1.  Geometry: This section contains Geometry related problems and other useful structures used to solve this kind of problems. Some of these problems can be found in the book Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual.
2. BTree: Self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
3. Insertion Sort: Sorting algorithm that is performed in **O(n^2)** runtime but has a simple implementation.
4. Integer partitions: Given a positive integer n, generate all possible unique ways to represent n as a sum of positive integers. 
5. K-Subsets: Given an integer array of N elements, the task is to divide this array into K non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements in every subset is same. All elements of this array should be part of exactly one partition.
6. Knapsack problem:  Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
7. Parentheses balance: Checks if an expression with parentheses is balanced.
8. Set Partitions: Generates the all nonempty subsets from an array with the elements from 1 to n.
9. Shellsort: Variation of Insertion Sort, the idea of shellSort is to allow an exchange of far items.
10. Skip list: Data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements.  The search and insert operations take **O(log n)**
11. Splay Tree: Binary search tree that is auto adjusted and has the property that recently accessed elements can be accessed quickly.
12. Tournament Tree:  Form of min (max) heap which is a complete binary tree. Every external node represents a player and internal node represents winner. In a tournament tree, every internal node contains winner and every leaf node contains one player.  
**Note:** Many of the descriptions of the list were obtained from www.geeksforgeeks.org
# Cracking The Coding Interview
The folder CTCI contains some of the problems from the book Cracking The Coding Interview.
