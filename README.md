# Algorithm problems

This repository contains some exercises, examples and data structures from the book [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steve-Skiena/dp/1848000693/), everything was made using Swift 4.

# Others

Additionally, it contains some other popular problems, algorithms, and structures that came up frequently when I was reading this book. These additional items are listed here:
1. **[Geometry](Others/Geometry)**: This section contains Geometry related problems and other useful structures used to solve this kind of problems. Some of these problems can be found in the book [Programming Challenges: The Programming Contest Training Manual](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Programming-Challenges-Contest-Training-Manual/dp/0387001638).
2. **[BTree](Others/BTree.swift)**: Self-balancing tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
3. **[Insertion Sort](Others/InsertionSort.swift)**: Sorting algorithm that is performed in **O(n^2)** runtime but has a simple implementation.
4. **[Integer partitions](Others/IntegerPartition.swift)**: Given a positive integer n, generate all possible unique ways to represent n as a sum of positive integers. 
5. **[K-Subsets](Others/KSubsets.swift)**: Given an integer array of N elements, the task is to divide this array into K non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements in every subset is same. All elements of this array should be part of exactly one partition.
6. **[Knapsack problem](Others/Knapsack problem.swift)**:  Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
7. **[Parentheses balance](Others/ParenthesesBalance.swift)**: Checks if an expression with parentheses is balanced.
8. **[Set Partitions](Others/SetPartitions.swift)**: Generates the all nonempty subsets from an array with the elements from 1 to n.
9. **[Shellsort](Others/Shellsort.swift)**: Variation of Insertion Sort, the idea of shellSort is to allow an exchange of far items.
10. **[Skip list](Others/SkipList.swift)**: Data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements.  The search and insert operations take **O(log n)**
11. **[Splay Tree](Others/SplayTree.swift)**: Binary search tree that is auto adjusted and has the property that recently accessed elements can be accessed quickly.
12. **[Tournament Tree](Others/TournamentTree.swift)**:  Form of min (max) heap which is a complete binary tree. Every external node represents a player and internal node represents winner. In a tournament tree, every internal node contains winner and every leaf node contains one player.  

**Note:** Many of the descriptions of the list were obtained from [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)
# Cracking The Coding Interview
The folder [CTCI](CTCI/) contains some of the problems from the book Cracking The Coding Interview.
